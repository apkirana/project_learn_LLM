## Introduction

The TalkToEBM project aims to facilitate a user-friendly interface to interact with Explainable Boosting Machines, enabling users to obtain insights from machine learning models and making predictions in a conversational manner.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage with the model through a chatbot-style interface.
- **Model Explanation**: Users can ask for explanations of model predictions in a human-readable format.
- **Customizable**: Modify the underlying model and interaction logic to suit specific applications.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apkirana/project_learn_TalkToEBM.git
